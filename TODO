HIGH PRIORITY ==================================================================

- proxyAdmin.sh and proxyStart.sh able to specify VERBOSE for all of the
  proxyUtils functions:
  - Add error checking to the EncFS stuff.  Displaying error messages is part
    of this task.  They always get displayed, regardless of the VERBOSE level.
  - Fix so we can Add and Del directories.  That way we can cycle through a
    test cycle without cleaning up with an external script.
  - Add "restart on reboot" capability to EncFS.
  - proxyAdmin.sh wants a lot of stuff to NOT show up on the console.
  - proxyStart.sh wants everything to go into a log file for later viewing.

- Add encryption:
  - Clean up existing EncFS code.
  - Re-load after reboot.
  - Remove encrypted dir.

- Change build failures so they "trap".  This will let our trap function print
  an error message in red.

- Create ./test/deployAWS.sh to deploy NASProxy to Amazon AWS.

- Splash screen:

- Firmware upgrade:

- Debugging information:
  - Be able to extract data for debugging.

- Clean up:
  - The "expect" scripts don't handle failures correctly.  Figure out how to
    make the "expect" scritps recognize failures and return errors.
  - Ask user for timezone information.
  - Ask user for NTP information.
  - Lots of repeated stuff.  Move those things to commonUtils.
  - VM/buildVM.sh should show stats while downloading the large ISO files.

- TEST!

- CIFS
  - Export as either NFS or CIFS or BOTH.

LOWER PRIORITY =================================================================

- BUG: Need to reboot the VM in order for the correct IP Address to be set.

- Take care of all of the "TODO" messages in the scripts.

- CI/CD (Jenkins).

- systemd startup and shutdown improvements:
  - shutdown script.  Necessary for doing clean firmware upgrades.

V2 TASKS =======================================================================

- Cluster (multiple proxies working together (higher performance)).

- Configuration via web GUI.

- Configuration language with SSH access.  This allows the user to write scripts
  that do that configuration.

- Test automation using the SSH cli.
