HIGH PRIORITY ==================================================================

- PF:
  - Bootstrap (i.e. register with KS).
  - Configure a mount.
  - Then do the tasks listed in the "Encryption" section of this TODO list.

- Encryption:
  - Add error checking to the EncFS stuff.  Displaying error messages is part
    of this task.  They always get displayed, regardless of the VERBOSE level.
  - Fix so we can Add and Del directories.  That way we can run through a
    test cycle without cleaning up with an external script.
  - Add "restart on reboot" capability to EncFS.
  - proxyAdmin.sh wants a lot of stuff to NOT show up on the console, but it
    should go into the log file.
  - proxyStart.sh wants everything to go into a log file for later viewing.  Or
    maybe it actually does want it to go to the console, and "systemctl status"
    can retrieve it from /var/log/messages and display on the console.
  - Clean up existing EncFS code.
  - Re-load after reboot.
  - Remove encrypted dir(s) when doing a "Delete".

- Splash screen:

- Firmware upgrade:

- Debugging information:
  - Be able to extract data for debugging.

- Maintenance:
  - The "expect" scripts don't handle failures correctly.  Figure out how to
    make the "expect" scripts recognize failures and return errors.
  - Ask user for timezone information.
  - Ask user for NTP information.
  - Lots of repeated stuff.  Move those things to commonUtils.
  - VM/buildVM.sh should show stats while downloading the large ISO files.

- TEST!

- CIFS
  - Export as either NFS or CIFS or BOTH.

LOWER PRIORITY =================================================================

- proxy_bridge:
  - Maybe convert to a kernel module or high-level FUSE driver.
  - In the meantime, do some work to make it more robust and work really well.
    - Should be able to do a kernel build.

- BUG: Need to reboot the VM in order for the correct IP Address to be set.
       Right now it has a DHCP address and the static address.

- Take care of all of the "TODO" messages in the scripts.

- CI/CD (Jenkins).

- systemd startup and shutdown improvements:
  - shutdown script.  Necessary for doing clean firmware upgrades.

V2 TASKS =======================================================================

- Cluster (multiple proxies working together (higher performance and high
  assurance).

- Configuration via web GUI.

- Scripting language with SSH access.  This allows the user to write scripts
  that do the configuration.

- Test automation using the SSH cli.
