HIGH PRIORITY ==================================================================

- Generic NASProxy with no encryption on github.
  - CIFS

- Generic NASProxy with encryption:
  - EncFS.

- Build the OVA file:
  - Splash screen?

- systemd startup:
  - start script
  - shutdown script

- Clean up.
  - The "expect" scripts don't handle failures correctly.  Figure out how to
    make the "expect" scritps recognize failures and return errors.
  - Ask user for timezone information.
  - Let user change admin password.
  - Lots of repeated stuff.  Move those things to  commonUtils.
  - VM/buildVM.sh shows stats while downloading the large ISO files.

- Be able to add/del directories without restarting NFSD or SAMBA.

- Export as either NFS or CIFS or BOTH.
  - Command line switch to specify N/C/B (NFS/CIFS/BOTH) for client-side.

- Test 4 encrypted directories (2 NFS and 2 CIFS):
  - Make sure "Add" updates the database correctly.
  - Make sure "Del" updates the database correctly.
  - Shutdown and make sure they're shut down.
  - Restart and make sure they're restarted.

- TEST!

LOWER PRIORITY =================================================================

- Consider switching to Ubuntu:
  - Newer kernel means better FUSE performance.
  - Need a .DEB file in order to do this.

- Take care of all of the "TODO" messages in the scripts.

- CI/CD (Jenkins).

V2 TASKS =======================================================================

- Cluster (multiple proxies working together (higher performance)).

- Configuration via web GUI.
