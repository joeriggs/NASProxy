    make the "expect" scritps recognize failures and return errors.
  - Ask user for timezone information.
  - Ask user for NTP information.
  - Lots of repeated stuff.  Move those things to commonUtils.

LOWER PRIORITY =================================================================

- Take care of all of the "TODO" messages in the scripts.

- CI/CD (Jenkins).

  that do that configuration.
